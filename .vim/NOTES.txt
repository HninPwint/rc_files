In Insert mode:

  Ctrl-O lets you do ONE normal command (that's what I need for gvim -y!)

  Ctrl-A inserts the last insert again (in normal mode that is in register ".)

  Ctrl-Y insert the char from cell above the cursor

Execute a register as a command using @

  so @0 or @1 or @""

  "3p   will paste the yanked text 3 steps back

:u1 | u   go to initial state
:earlier 1f   go to state at previous file-save

When diffing two files:
  ]c   go to next difference
  [c   go to previous difference
  dp   put lines in current difference into other file
  do   obtain lines for current difference from other file

g;   go to position of last change
g,   go to position of next change
mx   create mark x
g'x  jump to mark x
     (use capital X for global, lower-case is buffer-local)

Don't forget, while n is the repeater for * or #, ; is the repeater for f t F and T.

:w !sudo tee %
