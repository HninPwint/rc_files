" When performing a search, displays "(n/m)" in the statusbar to indicate the
" index of the current line within the list of matching lines in the buffer.
"
" To use this you need to add the function to your status line, for example:
"
"   :let &statusline = '%{GetSearchStatus()}' . &statusline
"
" (Note that the total count of matching lines is not the same as the number
" of occurrences, because one line could contain more than one match!)
