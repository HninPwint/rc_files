" BreakIndent Beta tries to make wrapped lines look neater and less disruptive, by updating showbreak dynamically to match the indent of the current focused line.
"
" Vim's default 'wrap' mode shows wrapped lines unindented:
"
"     This line is indented and also very
" \ long so it was displayed wrapped.
"
" But with BreakIndent Beta, it would appear like this (when focused):
"
"     This line is indented and also very
"     \ long so it was displayed wrapped.
"
" Warning: Because it changes showbreak, it will cause lines to visibly shift left or right, and possibly up or down, when a new indent is applied.  To reduce how often this happens, you can enable breakindent_update_rarely or breakindent_never_shrink.
"
" BreakIndent Beta is a weak approximation of the 'breakindent' patch, which requires recompilation of Vim's source-code.  Unlike the patch, this script *cannot* present a different indent for each line.  Instead it updates the showbreak option to fit the indent of the *current* cursor line.  Unfortunately this means that showbreak can change often, and other lines on the display may not appear at the ideal indent.
"
" Since showbreak is a global, it will affect all windows; this can not be prevented.
"
" Some commands that may be useful when wrapping long lines:
"
"   :set wrap                  " This script does nothing in nowrap mode
"   :set linebreak nolist      " Break lines cleanly at word gaps, hide Tabs
"   :set list                  " Visible Tabs, but breaks words anywhere
"
"   :set formatopts-=ct        " Disable auto-linefeed when typing
"
"   :highlight NonText ctermfg=darkblue       " Theme your indent symbols
"   :nnoremap <Leader>w :set invwrap<Enter>   " Quick keybind to toggle wrap
"
" To get started finding your preferred settings, try out the following.
" You will need to move onto a wrapped line each time to trigger an update.
"
"   :let g:breakindent_char               " Check its current value
"   :let g:breakindent_char = '<'         " Try setting the char used to indent
"   :let g:breakindent_symbol             " Check its current value
"   :let g:breakindent_symbol = ' | '     " Try a flat continuation symbol
"   :let g:breakindent_match_gap = 1      " Enable first-word matching
"   :let g:breakindent_gapchar = '\'      " The symbol used below the word
"   :let g:breakindent_symbol = ' '       " After gapchars just put a space
"   :let g:breakindent_use_first_word = 1   " Use the first word as the symbol
"
" I also forked this script to create a version that sets the breakindent to the deepest (most indented) wrapped line currently on the screen.  This may be preferable if you dislike indents that are too shallow but don't mind indents that are too deep.  That version is in breakindent_beta.never_shallow.vim
"
" Alternative: The real breakindent patch is being kept up-to-date at: https://retracile.net/wiki/VimBreakIndent   (Look for the "Original Format" link at the bottom of the page)

" CONSIDER TODO: New feature.  There are occasionally situations where I would like more indentation than bi_b currently provides.  For example:
"
"     // This C comment contains a list:
"     //   - First item.
"     //   - This particular list item is very very
"            \ long and so it wraps.
"     //   - Another list item.
"
" As you can see, I would like the wrapped indentation to be much deeper than usual, simply because this long line is a list item.
" Probably the best way to deal with this is to allow a regexp (or perhaps for clarity, a list of regexps) to pick out these special lines.  Each regexp might have some extra rules attached about how far to indent.  E.g. some users might prefer the \ to appear under the - in the previous example (depends whether he prefers the words aligned, or likes to see the vertical gap between '-'s).

This can look neat for comments, but can also be misleading: only the colour indicates that the breakindentsymbol is NOT part of the text!  For non-comment wrapped lines it just looks stupid/confusing.  A future improvement could allow a regexp to be provided for which the word would be copied, otherwise only its length would be used.
