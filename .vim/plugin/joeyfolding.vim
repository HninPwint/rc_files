" - It can detect some foldable blocks which Vim doesn't auto-detect:
" - It has rules for folding diff/patch files :D
" - It will always fold { ... } blocks
" - It can also fold: C++ #ifdefs, Latex
" If folding is still poor after :Joeyfolding, try :set foldmethod=index

" Much of this is now in treefolding.vim, which is auto-generated from treevim.sh.
" Can we hope to factor out the common code?  (jsh script <-dep-> joey rc script)
