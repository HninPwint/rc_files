" ShowOtherEnd by Joey
" Prints the line at the opposite end of % without actually going there, so in
" long files you can check the context of closing lines, such as:
"   endif  fi  }  struct  typedef  ]  )  }}}  ...

" TODO: Check if % jump leaves us on the same line
" DONE: Store and restore original position, in case % doesn't quite.
" TODO: Suppress scroll caused by cursor jump if possible.  (Defer display update.)
"       Failing suppression, just store scroll pos before and restore it after.
" TODO: Auto-activate when arriving on a line/char deemed to be suitable (see list above).
" TODO: If auto-activating, then also trim length of message string, to avoid "Press ENTER" message.  (See EchoShort in taglist.vim)
" DONE: For fun, also show number of lines in the block.
