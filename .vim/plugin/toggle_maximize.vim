" ToggleMaximize v1.2.2 by joey.neuralyte.org
"
" Vim can support complex window layouts, but they can put users off because
" they reduce the size of the main editing window.  ToggleMaximize addresses
" this issue, by allowing the user to switch between a large editor window,
" and his own complex window layout.
"
" Press Ctrl-F or Ctrl-\ to maximize the size of the current window, press
" again to restore the original window layout.
"
" Ctrl-V and Ctrl-H toggle maximize in horizontal/vertical direction only.
"
" Maximization is forced to respect winminwidth and winminheight, so if you
" have these set, other windows will not fully shrink to the edges.
"
" Extra feature: If you mess up your layout and want to restore it to what you
" had the last time you maximized, you can :call RestoreLayout()
"
" Extra feature/bug: If the user changes the size of any windows after
" maximizing, the script still thinks the toggle is ON, so next time it is
" used it will restore your old layout, rather than re-maximize.  (To force
" your new layout to be adopted, you could :call StoreLayout() and then reset
" the toggle.)

" IMPLEMENTATION: Maximizing a window is easy.  We can use :resize and :vert
" resize, or we can set winheight/width.  But restoring the original layout is
" harder!  To do this, we visit all windows before maximizing, and store their
" dimensions.  Then when restoring we visit all windows again, this time using
" the stored data to restore their dimensions.

" TODO: Arguably a better solution would be for "maximization" to simply open
" a new tab with the current buffer, and for "restoration" to close it and
" return to the previous tab.  Unfortunately if MiniBufExplorer is present, he
" may decide to add himself to the maximized tab.  Also this approach cannot
" support independent vertical and horizontal maximizing.

" ISSUES: We had problems accurately restoring the window layout, because
" windows would interfere with each other while we were restoring their sizes.
" (perhaps due to winfixwidth).  It seems WinDoBothWays() has overcome this.

" BUG: Frequently restores windows which were height 0 with height &winheight,
" (and likewise for width) due to the fact that they are visited by windo, and
" resize 0 does nothing on the window you occupy!
" Presumably most earlier versions also had this issue.
" Any workarounds for this?  If we could record which windows which were
" height 0, we could simply skip visiting them when restoring.  Oh look
" winheight() can accept a window number, so we can collect window size data
" without ever visiting them!

" TOTEST: Can large values of winwidth/height cause problems restoring layout?

" DONE: (Option ToggleMaximizeStayMaximized) Temporarily set high values for
" winheight/width during maximization, so that the focused window stays
" maximized if the user switch between windows, but settings will be normal
" when they restore to preferred layout.  (This is actually how the script
" originally worked before :resize)  Note this does not work on windows which
" have set winfixwidth/height.
