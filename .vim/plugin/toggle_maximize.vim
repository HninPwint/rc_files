" ToggleMaximize v1.4.0 by joey.neuralyte.org
"
" Vim can support complex window layouts, but they can put users off because
" they reduce the size of the main editing window.  ToggleMaximize addresses
" this issue, by allowing the user to switch between a large editor window,
" and his own complex window layout.
"
" Press Ctrl-F or Ctrl-\ to maximize the size of the current window, press
" again to restore the original window layout.
"
" Ctrl-V and Ctrl-H toggle maximize in vertical/horizontal direction only.
"
" Maximization is forced to respect winminwidth and winminheight, so if you
" have these set, other windows will not fully shrink to the edges.
" Restoration is forced to respect winheight.
"
" If the user changes the size of any windows after maximizing, the script
" still thinks the toggle is ON, so next time it is used it will restore your
" old layout, rather than re-maximize.

" 2011/12/15  Version 1.4 uses winrestcmd() and is a bit faster.  (Old methods
" of restoration via WinDo() tended to trigger WinEnter events in other
" plugins, e.g. MBE/Taglist.)

" CONSIDER: An alternative solution would be for "maximization" to simply open
" a new tab with the current buffer, and for "restoration" to close it and
" return to the previous tab.


"" OLD DOCS:

" TODO: Large values of winwidth/height can cause problems restoring layout.
" Width is ok because we do that last, but when we visit windows to restore
" width, winheight may alter previously correct heights!
" SOLUTION: restore width+height at the same time.
" SOLUTION: temporarily set winwidth/height to 1 while we are restoring.
" Although we cannot do that if winminwidth/height are > 1.  Grrr!
" So we might need to temporarily alter winminwidth/height too!
" CURRENTLY: Left to the user to set winwidth/height low or live with the bug!

" SUCKS: Resizing Vim in your window manager does not cause winheight to be
"        re-enforced (until you change window).

let s:oldwinwidth  = 1

" SUCKS: After all that refactoring, I note that windowid-indexed values apply
" to different windows when windows are closed or created, whereas
" window-local variables clean themselves up more tidily.
