" Creating a swapfile for every FUCKING file we open just sucks major balls.
" I have a zillion swapfiles on my system, 99% of which are identical to the
" file, and 0.9% of which are OLD fucking versions of the file.
" If I am lucky, 1 in 1000 times I am asked to recover a swapfile, it actually
" contains unwritten text which could have been lost zomg.

" Anyway rant over.
" This plugin only enables the swapfile when we start modifying a buffer.
" Like duh.

" Disadvantages / BUGs:
" Because it sets swapfile in the middle of editing, that is the moment when
" it will prompt you if it finds an old swapfile.
" To work around this, perhaps we should check for a swapfile the first time
" we open a file?
" For the moment, disabling on InsertEnter and CursorHoldI.  That means we
" might not create a swapfile during the first edit.  Gah.

" Allows plugin to be enabled/disabled from config and also at runtime.

" Advantages: If you do a long edit without leaving insert mode, your changes
" will be safely stored in the swapfile.
" Disadvantages: If a swapfile is present, you will be interrupted while
" entering insert mode.

" triggering a "Press ENTER to continue" message.  If you remove this, you may
