" Vim swapfiles tend to become more of a hindrance than a feature.  If you set
" swapfile and hidden, and don't close your vim properly, then there will be a
" swapfile created for every buffer you had opened.  You may end up with a
" lots of swapfiles on your system, and be unsure which hold old versions,
" up-to-date versions, or new versions of the file.
"
" This plugin only enables the swapfile when we start modifying a buffer.
"
" After saving a buffer, the swapfile will be removed if you unfocus the
" buffer via a BufLeave or BufWinLeave event.
"
" Issues:
"
" - If you prefer to remove the swapfile immediately after each save, do this
"   before loading:
"
"     let g:NoSwapSuck_CloseSwapfileOnWrite = 0
"
"   But if your workflow involves an edit-save-edit-save loop, this setting
"   will keep creating and destroying the swapfile.
"
"   That behaviour may be undesirable in the following situations:
"
"   - you are trying to preserve battery,
"   - your files are very large, or
"   - your drive is very slow (perhaps saving over a network).
"
" - Because the script sets 'swapfile' in the middle of editing, that is the
"   moment when it will prompt you if it finds an old swapfile.  Ideally it
"   will prompt earlier, but that is not always the case.
"
" - When debugging, the initial message "Setting NO swapfile" may trigger a
"   "Press ENTER to continue" message.  To avoid that, you could do this
"   before loading noswapfile.vim:
"
"     setglobal noswapfile

" TODO:
" - All options should work at runtime, including Enable and CloseSwapfileOnWrite.



" Options:

" Allows plugin to be enabled/disabled from config and also at runtime.
let g:NoSwapSuck_Enabled = get(g:, 'NoSwapSuck_Enabled', 1)

" Will echo when swapfile is turned on or off
let g:NoSwapSuck_Debug = get(g:, 'NoSwapSuck_Debug', 0)

" check if there is a swapfile present for that file.
let g:NoSwapSuck_CheckSwapfileOnLoad = get(g:, 'NoSwapSuck_CheckSwapfileOnLoad', 1)

" Create a swapfile immediately before entering Insert mode.
"
" Advantages: If you do a long edit without leaving insert mode, your changes
" will be safely stored in the swapfile, protected from powerloss / reset.
"
" Disadvantages: If a swapfile is present, and you didn't check on load, you
" will be interrupted while entering insert mode.
