" Allows you to review changes between saved file and working buffer.
" Writes buffer to a temp-file, then calls GNU diff, or whatever is set in DAFOD_diffcmd.

" Can be useful if Vim says "File changed on disk. (L)oad or (O)k?" you can
" select OK then do :DiffAgainstFileOnDisk to decide whether to overwrite
" (:w!) or read (:e!) the file.

" Can also be useful if Vim says there is a swapfile: you can (R)ecover it,
" diff it against the file on disk, and then decide whether to keep it or :e!

"" TOTEST: Accidentally running on unnamed buffer may give it name of tmpfile.  Not really a problem, just inconsistent.
