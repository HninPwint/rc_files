		" If the file was opened with a leading './' we remove it.
		" We can also remove the current working directory from the path, if we want to.
		" When manually running ctags, you should be sure to create filenames with the same path, or we will see duplicates in the tag file.

" TODO: Update ../tags or ../../tags or ../../../tags if it exists.  Could cache it in b:my_nearest_tagsfile.
" In that case, the path normalization above should be done relative to the folder containing that tags file, not cwd.
" But perhaps better we should `cd` to the same folder as `tags`, and always normalize paths relative to that folder.
