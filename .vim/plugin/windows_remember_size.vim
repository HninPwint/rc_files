" BUGS:
" When we add a new window to the list, e.g. TagList, when switching to it, the old unfocused size of the previous window from the *old* layout is applied.
" I think we need to forget some things when layout changes?  Forget all unfocused sizes?
" Or perhaps when a new window enters the layout, we should quickly grab its dimensions and set those as its focused and unfocused size?

" OK I like this version a lot now.  With the exception of the major bugs, which is when new windows are made, sometimes a window will end up 0 height or 0 width.
" When we are thinking of restoring or saving values, we could check the number of windows (or even their names) to see if any change has occured.
" New windows should be encouraged to take 50% of the space I guess, as per Vim's default.

" Perhaps what we should do is have window remember their relative size rather than their actual size.  Would this be a percentage, or a ratio?
" Then what do we do when a new window is created?  Shrink them all by 10%?  Shrink them intelligently?

"" Old version: only stores when use changes size with common mapping.

" When you set the size of a window (presently using keymaps) it remembers its
" size, and restores to that size the next time you enter it.

" Ideally instead of keymaps would could intercept user-originated calls to
" :resize, e.g. from the mouse or from user or default mappings.
" (There is no WinResized event to attach to.)

" Alternatively, we could try *always* storing the size:
" autocmd WinLeave * call <SID>RememberHeight() | call <SID>RememberWidth()

" BUG: Occasionally I press the restore button and it goes mad.  This might be
" related to me maximizing the window in X.

" I might deprecate this script in favour of:
" Allow setting of layout "strategy", one of which could be:
"   - Divide height 1/3 last window, 2/3rds this window, shrink rest.
"   (Perhaps 3rd last give 1 line, others 0, or 3 and 1.)
"   - Perhaps I even want my windows to cycle for me, so if I am focused on
"   say the bottom one, the 3 above keep getting updated to display the
"   previous 3 buffers I entered.

" CONSIDER TODO: Sometimes the resize rules we set get confused when we create
" a new window (window numbers change).  Perhaps it would feel nicer to
" associate remembered height/width with the buffer, not the window?

" Intercept the normal resize keys:
