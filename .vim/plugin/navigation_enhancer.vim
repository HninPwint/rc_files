" Navigation Enhancer v1.2 by joey.neuralyte.org
"
" When moving the cursor between windows, given a choice of target windows,
" Vim uses the *cursor position* to choose the destination window.
"
" However I think a better approach when there may be more than one potential
" target window is to pick the one which was *used most recently*.
"
" So now if I casually move between windows in one direction, and then in the
" opposite direction, I should always return to the window I started from!
"
" ISSUES: The side-effects of windo are undesirable.  To avoid windo, we could
" lazily maintain a script-global data structure representing which windows
" may be reached from which others.
"
" BUG: localtime() is only accurate to the second, which is occasionally too
" coarse.

" Set up event listener to store lastUsed time when leaving a window
" But do not update window visits when traversing windows for app purposes!
let g:updateTimes = 1   " This was a s: but g: is better for development
auto BufLeave * if g:updateTimes | let w:lastUsed = localtime() | endif
" NOTE: Other scripts who traverse windows, (with or without windo, e.g.
" toggle_maximize.vim) may freshen these times when we don't want them to!
" To work around this, perhaps we could update only when we detect movement
" through a keybind.

"" Override Vim's default keymaps for window navigation:
" noremap  <silent> <C-W><Up>      :call SeekBestWindow("k","j")<Enter>
" inoremap <silent> <C-W><Up>      <Esc>:call SeekBestWindow("k","j")<Enter>a
" noremap  <silent> <C-W><Down>    :call SeekBestWindow("j","k")<Enter>
" inoremap <silent> <C-W><Down>    <Esc>:call SeekBestWindow("j","k")<Enter>a
" noremap  <silent> <C-W><C-Left>  :call SeekBestWindow("h","l")<Enter>
" inoremap <silent> <C-W><C-Left>  <Esc>:call SeekBestWindow("h","l")<Enter>a
" noremap  <silent> <C-W><C-Right> :call SeekBestWindow("l","h")<Enter>
" inoremap <silent> <C-W><C-Right> <Esc>:call SeekBestWindow("l","h")<Enter>a

"" Or leave them unchanged, and use my preferred shortcuts:
noremap  <silent> <C-Up>         :call <SID>SeekBestWindow("k","j")<Enter>
inoremap <silent> <C-Up>    <Esc>:call <SID>SeekBestWindow("k","j")<Enter>a
