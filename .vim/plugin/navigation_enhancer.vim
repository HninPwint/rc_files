" Navigation Enhancer v1.0 by JoeyTwiddle
"
" When moving the cursor between windows, given a choice of target windows,
" Vim uses the *cursor position* to choose the destination window.
"
" However I think a better approach when there may be more than one potential
" target window is to pick the one which was *used most recently*.
"
" So now if I casually move between windows in one direction, and then in the
" opposite direction, I should always return to the window I started from!

" Set up event listener to store lastUsed time when leaving a window
" But do not update window visits when traversing windows for app purposes!
let s:updateTimes = 1
auto BufLeave * if s:updateTimes | let w:lastUsed = localtime() | endif
" NOTE: Other scripts who traverse windows, (with or without windo, e.g.
" toggle_maximize.vim) may freshen these times when we don't want them to!
