# Use the help like crazy

Vim's inline help can tell you about all the commands, keystrokes, options and standard functions available in Vim.

If you aren't already using completion to find help tags, then try this:

    :h func<C-d>    " Shows a list of matching tags

    :h func<Tab>    " Lets you Tab through the tags to select the one you want

Some characters at the start or end of the tag help to differentiate the type of object being documented:

    n                   The n key in normal mode
    CTRL_D              The <Ctrl-D> key in normal mode
    c_CTRL_D            The <Ctrl-D> key in command mode
    :%                  The % command in ex mode / command mode / Vimscript
    'ch'                The ch option (short for cmdheight)
    strlen(             The strlen function
    b:                  The b variable prefix

If you want to find out what a key does, but it is not a normal key, you can use `<C-v>` to help insert it.  For example, if you are curious what the `<C-f>` key does, type the following:

    :h <C-v><C-f>

When reading the help, you can use `<C-]>` to follow a tag and `<C-o>` to go back.


# Config

A common pattern I see to ensure config variables are initialised is:

    if !exists("g:MyPlugin_OptionFoo")
        let g:MyPlugin_OptionFoo = ...default value here...
    endif

This allows users to override your defaults in their `.vimrc`.  And it ensures the variable exists when your script wants to read it.

Alternatively, to save creating config vars that are not read too often, you can use `get()` when you want to read them.  So instead of writing:

    g:MyPlugin_OptionFoo

you can write:

    get(g:, "MyPlugin_OptionFoo", ...default value here...)

which will provide the default value if the variable has not been set.

However I somewhat prefer setting up a global variable, so that the user can find it and change it more easily at runtime, using completion on the commandline.

Using the `get()` function we can in fact do the original initialization in one line:

    let g:MyPlugin_OptionFoo = get(g:, "MyPlugin_OptionFoo", ...default value here...)


# Localise functions and variables to your script

Call your functions `s:MyFunc` instead of just `MyFunc` so that they stay local to the script.  This avoids conflicting with any other scripts which defined functions in the global scope.

You can call a script-local function easily from within an autocommand, but from a mapping you must use `<SID>`:

    autocmd CursorHold * call s:ResetCmdHeight()
    nnoremap <C-L> :call <SID>ResetCmdHeight()<CR>

For variables which you do not want the user to edit, make them script-local too.  For example your on/off toggle could be `s:enabled`.

But if you really want to use global variables (so the user can change them) or window-local variables, it is a good idea to namespace them, to avoid conflict with other scripts.  For example:

    g:MyPlugin_Enabled
    w:MyPlugin_Enabled


# Use `function!` to make your script re-loadable

Some scripts begin with:

    if exists('g:MyPlugin_IsLoaded')
        finish
    endif
    let g:MyPlugin_IsLoaded = 1

I do not recommend this because while you are developing your script, or someone else is trying to extend it, you will not be able to reload it; instead you will need to keep restarting Vim!

The pattern I prefer is to overwrite old functions, so you can easily reload the script when you change it:

    function! s:MyFunc()
        ...
    endfunction


# Make autocmds clearable and reloadable

When declaring an autocmd, use the following pattern:

    augroup MyPlugin
        " This clears all existing mappings in the group MyPlugin
        autocmd!
        " Put your autocmd definitions here ...
        autocmd CursorHold * call s:ResetCmdHeight()
    augroup END

Now if your script is sourced for a second time, the `autocmd!` will wipe out your previous autocmds before creating the new ones.  This will prevent any calls to old unwanted functions.


# Use `normal!` with a pling

You should almost always use

    normal! <cmd>

instead of

    normal <cmd>

so that you bypass any user-defined keymaps, and execute `<cmd>` using standard vim commands.


# Mappings

Similarly with mappings, `nnoremap` is better than `nmap`, unless you actually want your mapping to run custom mappings defined by the user (or other scripts).

If your script creates default keybindings, you should provide an option to disable this behaviour, or redefine the key.

    if !exists("g:MyPlugin_KeyForFooFeature")
        let g:MyPlugin_KeyForFooFeature = '<C-b>'
    endif
    " ...
    if g:MyPlugin_KeyForFooFeature != ""
        exec "nnoremap <silent> ".g:MyPlugin_KeyForFooFeature." :call s:RunFooFeature()<CR>"
    endif

You can also use `maparg()` to check if a user-defined mapping exists, before you overwrite it.

It is quite popular to create default mappings on `<Leader>k` where `k` is a key of your choice.  This avoids changing Vim's default keys in normal mode.


# Localise mappings to the relevant filetype(s)

If your mappings apply to certain types of file, then it makes more sense to create them local to buffers of only that filetype, rather than have them apply to *all* the buffers.

    au BufEnter *.{py,PY}   nnoremap <buffer> ...your mapping for python buffers only...


# Write lots of functions

As well as making things re-usable, functions names can be more meaningful names than direct commands, and so make your script easier to understand when reading.


# Make your script lazy-load by moving it into the autoload folder

If your script is not something that will be used in *every* Vim session, you can reduce Vim's startup time, by putting all the functions in a file called `autoload/myplugin.vim`.  You must rename functions in that file like so:

    function! myplugin#MyFunction()
        ...
    endfunction

You will also need to rename *calls* to those functions.  When Vim sees an attempt to `:call plugin_name#Func_Name` it will automatically load the file `autoload/plugin_name.vim` if it has not already done so, and then call the function.

If you still want to map keybinds or setup autocmds for every session, these should be kept in the normal `plugin/` folder.  Your mapping could autoload your script and call your function:

    nmap <silent> <C-F> :call myplugin#MyFunction()<Enter>

Users will be grateful that your script does not greatly impact Vim's startup time.  It will only do the extra work of loading your plugin when it is needed.
