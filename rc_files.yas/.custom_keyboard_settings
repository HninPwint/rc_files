# I seem to have some kind of US keyboard here.  I was just getting used to it when I accidentally loaded a GB layout.  Then I decided to complete it.

# Set to GB keyboard layout
setxkbmap -print gb | xkbcomp - "$DISPLAY"

# Now I have no `|` and no `\`
# Remap `Â¬` to `|`:
xmodmap -e "keycode 49 = grave bar backslash sterling"
# Use the spare "menu" key for `\`:
xmodmap -e "keycode 135 = backslash bar"
# I had wanted to put it on Ctrl-grave but this does not appear to be possible with xmodmap.

# Make Win-Left and Win-Right do Home and End (I got so used to Meta-Left and Meta-Right on my laptops)
# These do not work.
#xmodmap -e "keycode 113 = Left Home"
#xmodmap -e "keycode 114 = Right End"

# Notes:
# To list meta keys: xmodmap -pm
