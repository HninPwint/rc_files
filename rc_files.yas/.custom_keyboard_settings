# I seem to have some kind of US keyboard here.  I was just getting used to it when I accidentally loaded a GB layout.  Then I decided to complete it.

# Notes:
# To capture keycode numbers, you can use: xev
# NOTE: Be sure to read the number after "keycode" and not the number in brackets!
# To get the names of output chars for the right-hand side, you can look in: /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/us or /gb
# On some systems that folder is in /etc/X11/xkb
# To list meta keys: xmodmap -pm
# Some powerful techniques are available here: http://people.uleth.ca/~daniel.odonnell/Blog/custom-keyboard-in-linuxx11

# Set to GB keyboard layout
setxkbmap -print gb | xkbcomp - "$DISPLAY"

# Now I have no `|` and no `\`
# Remap `Â¬` to `|`:
xmodmap -e "keycode 49 = grave bar backslash sterling"
# Use the spare "menu" key for `\`:
xmodmap -e "keycode 135 = backslash bar"
# I had wanted to put it on Ctrl-grave but this does not appear to be possible with xmodmap.

# Make Win-Left and Win-Right do Home and End (I got so used to Meta-Left and Meta-Right on my laptops)
# These do not work.
#xmodmap -e "keycode 113 = Left Home"
#xmodmap -e "keycode 114 = Right End"

# Alternative
# Set to US keyboard layout:
setxkbmap -print us | xkbcomp - "$DISPLAY"

# Swap " and @
#xmodmap -e "keycode 11 = 2 quotedbl"
#xmodmap -e "keycode 48 = apostrophe at"
