=== If you want Lucida Console in GUI apps (e.g. GVim) ===

You can use the TTF file from this folder.  (Or you might find it in the msttcorefonts package.)

    sudo ln -s $PWD /usr/share/fonts/truetype/

On some systems the target folder may be called `truetype1`.

You may also need to run ./rebuild_font_cache.sh but I did not need this on Ubuntu 12.4



=== If you want screen fonts in GUI apps ===

Two of my favourites are Schumacher Clean (aka clean) and lucidatypewriter.

Note that they are screen fonts so they will show with jagged edges!

Also beware: If Firefox is open it might start using screen fonts instead of anti-aliased fonts!  That problem seemed to go away after I restarted Firefox.

On Ubuntu screen fonts are hidden by default.

You can expose *all* screen fonts to GUI apps like this:

    sudo ln -s /etc/fonts/conf.avail/70-force-bitmaps.conf /etc/fonts/conf.d/

Or if you only want to whitelist Clean and LucidaTypewriter, you can use my custom config file:

    sudo cp "$PWD"/70-force-some-bitmaps.conf /etc/fonts/conf.d/

Afterwards you should do this:

    sudo dpkg-reconfigure fontconfig

I have been told the command goes like this on Debian:

    sudo dpkg-reconfigure fontconfig-configure



=== Mac OSX ===

The closest font I found on Mac was "Menlo".  "Monaco" is not bad but a little tall.  Another alternative is "Andale".

Curiously, if you install XQuartz on Mac OSX, it will immediately provide:

    -*-lucidatypewriter-*-*-*-*-*-80-*-*-m-*-*-*

for you, but not:

    -b&h-lucidatypewriter-medium-r-normal-*-*-80-*-*-m-*-iso8859-1
