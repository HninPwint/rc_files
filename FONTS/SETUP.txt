sudo ln -s $PWD /usr/share/fonts/truetype/

# On some systems the target folder may be called truetype1.
# You may also need to run ./rebuild_font_cache.sh but I did not need this on Ubuntu 12.4

# Curiously, if you install QuartX on Mac OSX, it will immediately provide:

    -*-lucidatypewriter-*-*-*-*-*-80-*-*-m-*-*-*

for you, but not:

    -b&h-lucidatypewriter-medium-r-normal-*-*-80-*-*-m-*-iso8859-1
