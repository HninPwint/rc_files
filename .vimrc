	"" TODO: All these plugins reduce vim's startup time.
	"" This is not just about Vim processing the scripts, a significant cost is the traversal of all the filesystem folders for the following plugins.  (To demonstrate this, try opening vim twice in a row - only the first time is slow!)
	"" Tactics:
	"" - Separate into essential and optional plugins.  On very slow machines, only load the former.
	""   (I also want to separate out "must-try" plugins for sharing with others, from those plugins which I suspect not so many people will enjoy.)
	"" - Lazy-load plugins which are only sometimes needed.  E.g. rare language-specific plugins like 'vaxe' and 'jade' could be loaded differently.  (Well they aren't actually loaded now, but their tree is added to runtimepath, slowing startup.)
