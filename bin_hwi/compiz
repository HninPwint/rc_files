## --indirect-rendering to fix the black window bug on nVidia and compiz < 10
## LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT=1 for the same, may work a bit better
## --loose-binding to improve performance on nVidia
## --ignore-desktop-hints to ignore KDE's number-of-desktops settings

( sleep 2 ; gtk-window-decorator --replace ) &

# LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT=1
exec /usr/bin/compiz "$@"
# --ignore-desktop-hints --indirect-rendering --loose-binding 

## One time using --ignore-desktop-hints brought my windows back on the right desktops when I restarted compiz!
## OTOH the next day, removing it did the same!
## I seem to get fewer black windows with LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT=1
## --indirect-rendering seems to (sometimes) make things really slow and broken
## Then again sometimes things are slow without it too!
