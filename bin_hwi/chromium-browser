## Now just using the one in the google-chrome-stable=23.0.1271.97-r171054 package
# google-chrome "$@"

# ## I think sync may be the cause of browser not reloading properly :P
# ## This was after I killed chrome cos it had gone mental.

# ## Experimenting with this one:
# # --process-per-tab
# ## No on second thought, let's try this one:
# # --process-per-site
# ## The default is process-per-site-instance.
# 
# ### NVidia black windows when short on memory:
# ## Removed --process-per-site after [15279:15279:2121525889035:ERROR:x11_util.cc(814)] X Error detected: serial 53, error_code 11 (BadAlloc (insufficient resources for operation)), request_code 136, minor_code 27 (X_GLXCreatePbuffer)
# ## which I am still getting :F
# ## But now I am getting:
# #[29714:29714:2122076428232:ERROR:gles2_cmd_decoder.cc(2314)] GLES2DecoderImpl::UpdateOffscreenFrameBufferSize failed because offscreen FBO was incomplete.

# ## Well it was pretty much NVidia's fault I believe.  I didn't resort to a restart, I just closed a lot of windows and NV got some memory to work with.

# # To try to use hardware rendering, even without the right hardware: --ignore-gpu-blacklist --enable-webgl --enable-accelerated-2d-canvas --enable-accelerated-layers
# # To use software rendering for WebGL: -blacklist-accelerated-compositing and -blacklist-webgl
# 
# ## This may give some savings when a large number of our tabs are hibernated.

# ## Occasionally useful:
# # --disable-extensions
